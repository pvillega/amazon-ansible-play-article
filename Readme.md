# Amazon AWS and Play

This project is a sample on how to create a Play 2.1.3 project integrated with Amazon AWS (RDS, DynamoDB, autoscale) and how to use Ansible to automatically deploy it in AWS.

The following content is included:
* play-sample-app     A sample Play 2.1.3 app that integrates with AWS. It displays Flickr photos whose details are stored in DynamoDB. Integrates user authentication.
* ansible-scripts     A set of Ansible scripts to deploy the sample app in Amazon AWS

As a sample, the contents of this project can be used to create your own project and deploy it in AWS. Just use this as a template and extend as required.
